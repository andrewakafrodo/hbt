# hbt


* Install MongoDB if you haven't already.
* Install Python if you haven't already.


Once everything is installed, start the `mongod` process by enterting this command into your terminal:

    $ mongod

If you want to fork the process, enter this instead.

    $ mongod --fork

Once this is running, simply run the `hbt.py` file to start the app by entering this command:

	$ python hbt.py


And you're done! The site runs on port `8080` on your localhost.
